# AniList Integration

Momotaro integrates with AniList for:
1. **Metadata enrichment** — fetch titles, descriptions, genres, cover art
2. **Progress sync** — push reading progress back to the user's AniList list

## Per-Device Login

AniList login is **per device** (per browser). Each browser generates a UUID on first load, stores it in `localStorage` as `momotaro_device_id`, and sends it as the `X-Device-ID` header on every API request.

The server stores login state in the `device_anilist_sessions` table keyed by `device_id`. Logging in on one device does not affect any other device's session. Logging out only clears the session for the requesting device.

The OAuth client credentials (`anilist_client_id`, `anilist_client_secret`) are still global — stored in the `settings` table — since they belong to the server's registered AniList application, not to individual users.

## OAuth Setup

AniList uses OAuth 2.0. The user must create an AniList API application and supply the client ID and secret in Settings.

**Flow:**
1. User enters client ID + secret in Settings → stored in `settings` table
2. Frontend redirects user to `https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/authorize?...`
3. AniList redirects back to `<origin>/anilist/callback` with `?code=...`
4. `AnilistCallback.jsx` POSTs the code to `POST /api/auth/anilist/exchange`
5. Server exchanges code for access token via AniList token endpoint
6. Token stored in `device_anilist_sessions` for the requesting device's `X-Device-ID`

## Metadata Fetch

Triggered automatically on scan (if `METADATA_FETCH_ENABLED=true`) or manually via the "Refresh Metadata" button in MangaDetail.

The server searches AniList by the manga's folder name / title, picks the best match, and stores:
- `anilist_id`, `mal_id`
- `title`, `description`, `status`, `year`, `genres`, `score`
- `author` — extracted from the AniList `staff` edges (see below)
- `track_volumes` — set to `1` if the AniList entry tracks volumes rather than chapters (e.g. light novels)
- `cover_image` — downloaded and saved as thumbnail

### Author Extraction from Staff

The `MEDIA_FIELDS` GraphQL fragment requests `staff(perPage: 10, sort: [RELEVANCE]) { edges { role node { name { full } } } }`. After fetching, `normalizeMedia()` filters edges to roles `"Story & Art"`, `"Story"`, and `"Art"`, deduplicates the resulting names, and joins them with `", "`. The result is stored in `manga.author`.

If no staff edges match those roles the field is stored as `null` and the author label is omitted on the manga page.

## Progress Sync

Triggered **asynchronously** after every `PUT /api/progress/:mangaId` call. The HTTP response is sent first; sync happens in the background.

The `PUT /api/progress/:mangaId` handler extracts `X-Device-ID` from the request header and passes it to `syncToAniList()`. That function looks up the token from `device_anilist_sessions` for that device. If the device has no AniList session, sync is skipped silently.

Logic in [server/src/routes/progress.js](../server/src/routes/progress.js) → `syncToAniList()`:

1. Look up `anilist_token` and `anilist_user_id` from `device_anilist_sessions` for the request's `device_id` — skip if not logged in
2. Check `manga.anilist_id` — skip if no AniList match
3. Skip if `completedChapters` is empty
4. Determine tracking mode from `manga.track_volumes`:
   - `track_volumes = 1` → query `chapters.volume` column → report as volume progress
   - `track_volumes = 0` → query `chapters.number` column → report as chapter progress
5. Find the **highest** completed number (`Math.floor(Math.max(...))`)
6. Fall back to `completedChapters.length` if no numbered entries exist
7. Determine status: `COMPLETED` if `completedChapters.length >= totalChapters`, else `CURRENT`
8. Call `saveMediaListEntry(token, anilistId, status, { chapters: N })` or `{ volumes: N }`

## Rate Limiting

`anilistRequest()` in `anilist.js` reads the rate-limit headers AniList returns on every response and adapts inter-call spacing accordingly. Bulk loops should consult `recommendedDelayMs()` instead of hardcoding a delay.

**Headers consumed:**

| Header | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Sets steady-state spacing to `60_000 / limit + 50 ms` (e.g. 717 ms at 90 req/min, 2 050 ms at the temporarily-degraded 30 req/min). |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | When ≤ 5, the spacing is stretched so the rest of the budget lands after `X-RateLimit-Reset`. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix-seconds anchor for the above. |
| `Retry-After` (on 429) | Drives the existing retry loop. |

The recommended delay is clamped to `[700, 5 000] ms`. A 429 forces it to 5 000 ms until headers from a successful response indicate the service is healthy again. The retry loop itself is unchanged: up to 3 attempts honouring `Retry-After` (capped at 90 s); throws `'AniList rate limit exceeded after 3 retries'` if all attempts fail.

**Adult content:** `Media(...)` queries do not pass `isAdult`, so AniList returns adult and SFW titles together. This matches the on-disk library scanner, which indexes whatever the user dropped in.

## GraphQL Queries Used

All in `server/src/metadata/anilist.js`:

| Function | Query | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fetchFromAniList(title, token)` | `Media(search)` | Auto-fetch best match by title |
| `searchAniList(query, token, page)` | `Page.media` | Manual search, returns up to 10 results |
| `fetchByAniListId(id, token)` | `Media(id)` | Fetch by known AniList ID |
| `saveMediaListEntry(token, id, status, opts)` | `SaveMediaListEntry` mutation | Update user's list entry |
| `getMediaListEntry(token, userId, mediaId)` | `MediaList` | Fetch user's existing list entry |
| `getViewer(token)` | `Viewer` | Get logged-in user profile |

All media queries use the shared `MEDIA_FIELDS` fragment which includes `staff` edges for author extraction.

## `track_volumes` Flag

When AniList marks a manga as tracking volumes (e.g. light novels published by volume rather than serialized chapters), the `manga.track_volumes` column is set to `1`.

This flag affects:
- **UI labels**: "Volume 1" instead of "Chapter 1" in MangaDetail and the reader
- **Progress sync**: volume numbers are reported to AniList instead of chapter numbers
- **Chapter display**: chapter entries show `Volume N` if only a volume number is parsed
